# The NEAR Community - Hello World


# What is the NEAR Community?

The NEAR Community is made up of Innovators, Creators, Contributors, and, of course, a few wild cards. We’re all here to build a stronger ecosystem.

We’re a diverse community made up of individuals, Guilds, and teams from all around the globe.

Want to dive in right away? Connect with a human over on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/XxveWn6bQT).


# Community at NEAR

There are hundreds of communities built on and around NEAR. Many of these are bound together as Guilds, whereas others take a less structured approach (but are equally valuable, nonetheless!).


## Guilds

In essence, Guilds are a group of individuals with a shared sense of purpose, vision, and goals. 

Guilds are fundamental to the community at NEAR and have played a significant role in building out the ecosystem and, importantly, ensuring that at NEAR everyone has a place they can call home.

Some service-style Guilds have evolved into incorporated companies and are now expanding their offerings to continue to build a sustainable revenue flow. All whilst still having deep-rooted connections with NEAR and the wider ecosystem.

## NEAR Meet

NEAR Meet is our worldwide meetup initiative.

The NEAR Community is global, and we believe that human connection is an essential part of a community - digital, or otherwise.

That’s why we’ve launched NEAR Meet, with a goal of empowering community leaders to independently organize local events around the world in order to build awareness of NEAR and engage contributors in strategic ways

Interested in connecting with others from the NEARVerse in person? Perhaps you’d like to kick start your own NEAR-focused meetup.
